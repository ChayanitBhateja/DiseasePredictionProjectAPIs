This repository contains the data science apis created in Python using FastAPI to use in the DiseasePredictionProject project repository.

There are some python files like dashapp.py was created during the learning phase.

I have created 3 apis.
1. for model prediction.
2. for providing an interactive dashboard.
3. for providing 3 distinct KPIs.
